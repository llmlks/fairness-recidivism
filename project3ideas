1. Race affects: count of priors (if system is racist), criminal charge names
	- Poor family -> more criminality
	- Poor neighbourhood -> more policing -> higher likelihood of getting caught and getting charges
	- Discriminatory laws related to crimes committed by different ethnic communities


2. Sex affects: Less data
	- Lower sentences for same crimes for women
	- Traditional gender roles: women stay at home, while men provide


3. Age affects: count of priors
	- The older a person is, the more likely they have a higher number of priors


4. Assumptions
	- Juvenile priors are not included in the prior counts (because some states give less weight to juvenile priors)
	

5. Questions:
	- Should juvenile crimes affect the scoring?
	- Does the meaning of prior count depend on the person's age?
	- Is it more meaningful that a person has no priors if they are old?
	- Should the loss be symmetric (which is worse, False Positive or False Negative)


6. Check for refences:
	- Sentencing length for genders
	


7. Should time of arrest/crime/etc be a factor (because of changing laws and social climate)


8. Difference between two_years_recid and is_recid? Original analysis by propublica uses two_years_recid for analysis and is_recid for filtering
